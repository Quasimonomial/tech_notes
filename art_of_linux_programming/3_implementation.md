# Part Three: Implementation
## Chapter 14: Languages
* This chapter isn’t particularly helpful compared to the others; no notes here

## Chapter 15: Tools
* This chapter has lots of detail on technical tools, but doesn’t have information on modern tools (talking about version control w / o _git_)  and not the best place to learn about domain-specific tooling that is still used like _make_/

## Chapter 16: Reuse
* Don’t re-invent the wheel, use working software when known solutions exist
* Transparency is the key to reuse; if code isn’t transparent it won’t be reused
* Documentation always has the map problem — the code itself is needed to use anything
* To do this, you always need the source code to see internals, and modify them if nessesary
* This means open source in a lot of cases
* (A lot of this chapter is spent defending open source vs commercial code, don’t see a need to repeat it here)
* What qualifies as open source?
	* An unlimited right to copy be granted
	* An unlimited right to redistribute in unmodified form be granted
	* An unlimited right to modify for personal use be granted
